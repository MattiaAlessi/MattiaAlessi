*Welcome, brave visitor! You've found the treasure... now where did I put it?*

## ⚡ Currently
- 📖 Reading: Probably some fantasy novel instead of documentation  
- 🎮 Playing: With code until it works (or until I break everything)  
- ☕ Fuel: 80% coffee, 20% determination  
- 🌙 Sleep Schedule: "I'll fix it tomorrow"

### P.S.
If my code works, it's probably a happy accident.  
If it doesn't, it's *"experimental"*.
